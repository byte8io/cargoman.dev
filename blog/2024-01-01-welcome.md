We're excited to introduce **Cargoman** - a high-performance private Composer package registry built with Rust.

<!-- truncate -->

## Why We Built Cargoman

PHP extension vendors and enterprise teams need a reliable way to distribute private packages. Existing solutions are either:

- Too expensive for small teams
- Too slow for large-scale deployments
- Missing critical features like subscription management

Cargoman solves all of these problems.

## Key Features

### Built with Rust

Cargoman is written in Rust, delivering exceptional performance:

- Handle thousands of requests per second
- Minimal memory footprint
- Single binary deployment

### Full Composer v2 Support

Drop-in replacement for Packagist with your private packages:

```bash
composer config repositories.cargoman composer https://packages.cargoman.io
composer require vendor/package
```

### Subscription Ready

Built-in customer management and access control:

- Per-customer access tokens
- Version constraints
- Subscription lifecycle (suspend, freeze, reactivate)
